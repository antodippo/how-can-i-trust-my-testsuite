# How can I trust my test suite?

You just started working on a new project. Or maybe you've been working on it since some time, and it evolved a lot, thanks to many different developers. This means that you probably don't have enough knowledge on how the automated tests are written, and how effective they are.

So, how can you be confident to ship new features in production, or to refactor that old piece of software that's slowing you down? Are you fairly sure that if your CI build is green you're not gonna break anything?

There are a lot of tools out there that give you some numbers about your code and your tests, like code coverage and CRAP metrics, but they are significant up to some extent.

In this talk, we will see how can you measure the effectiveness of your test suite, how you can actually improve it, and what are the benefits of having a reliable and comprehensive set of automated tests.
